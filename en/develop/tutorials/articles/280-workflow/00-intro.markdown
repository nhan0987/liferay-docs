# Workflow

[TOC levels=1-4]

Use the workflow framework to run assets through a business process that suit your
organization's needs. Workflow processes are created using XML or via the handy
[Kaleo Designer](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017894912-Kaleo-Designer)
tool that comes with DE subscriptions.

This set of tutorials delves into the following workflow framework topics:

- Creating Workflow Definitions (using XML)
- Enabling Assets for Workflow
- Creating Workflow Engine Adapters

To manage workflow definitions and define their assignment schemes, check out
the [workflow section of the administrator documentation](/docs/7-1/user/-/knowledge_base/u/workflow)(not yet
written).
